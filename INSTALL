I Automatic Installation

The library can be installed automatically by
running
./install.sh

This will download all dependencies (libdivsuftsort
and gtest), build them and install the include
files in ${HOME}/include and the libraries
in ${HOME}/lib. 
After running the script you can change into
the test directory and make and execute the tests by
make && make test

You can compile your own program example.cc by

g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -funroll-loops -I${HOME}/include/ -L${HOME}/lib/ -o example example.cc -lsdsl -ldivsufsort -ldivsufsort64


If the automatic installation fails (maybe you have not a download
program like curl or wget installed) then you can try the 
manual installation:

II Manual Installation

1. a) download the libdivsufsort of Yuta Mori from
      http://code.google.com/p/libdivsufsort/

      open the CMakeList.txt file with an editor and
	  change the option BUILD_DIVSUFSORT64 from OFF to ON
   c) create a build directory (in libdivsufsort-2.0.1)
   d) cd build
   e) cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}
   f) make
   g) make install  
2. a) goto the build directory /path/to/sdsl/build 
   b) cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}
